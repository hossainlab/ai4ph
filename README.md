## 📌 Course Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping public health by improving epidemiological research, disease surveillance, diagnostics, and drug discovery. In Bangladesh, this transformation is particularly relevant due to the increasing availability of health data and digital health tools. However, there exists a gap in workforce capacity to use AI in public health contexts.

This course is designed to bridge that gap by training a new generation of practitioners to critically apply AI in real-world public health challenges in low-resource settings like Bangladesh.
