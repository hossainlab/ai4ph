                            <p>The course requires a basic understanding of public health concepts, fundamental statistics knowledge, and basic computer literacy. While programming experience is helpful, it's not required as we'll teach Python from the ground up. We recommend familiarity with research methods and some background in epidemiology or biostatistics, but motivated students from various backgrounds are welcome.</p>
